        What we Offer!
        At this gym we will offer two types of training for three kidneys of memberships, MMA, PowerLifting, and then a membership for both. With this, customers can choose if they want to learn how to fight, train with professionals, or do both to reach a new level of athleticism. There will also be competitions that customers can enter so they can apply their fighting training and compare their strength with others among their weight class. By doing competitions we hope to give our customers more motivation to work and push themselves by being competitive with others. 
        What's on the Website? 
        This website will offer an overview of what the gym offers to its guests as well as provide information for the activities we offer in case people don’t know what powerlifting or MMA is. There will also be a page regarding frequently asked questions so we can, as a gym, provide a more trustworthy service towards our interested customers by giving them a better understanding of what specifically we offer.

      <h3>What is MMA and Powerlifting</h3>
      <p>
        What is MMA and PowerLifting? 
        Our gym offers two services, MMA and powerlifting but what are they? Well, MMA stands for mixed martial arts so you will be learning to wrestle, grapple, and other fighting techniques taught by our trained professionals and practice skills that you learn as a class and in groups. There will also be competitions we enter as a gym with our top fighters for each weight class entering, if they want to, to bring a competitive side of our training into our gym. Powerlifting is a strength sport that focuses on three lifts; squat, bench, and deadlift. With the powerlifting membership you will be given a personal trainer that will help give you a personal workout plan tailored to you to see the best gains. Similar to our MMA program, we will also have powerlifting competitions based on weight class if customers choose to enter. (Will be providing more information on MMA and Powerlifting in the future.)

      <h3>FAQ's</h3>
      <p>
        FAQ’s
        Why would I do both powerlifting and MMA? 
        There are a multitude of reasons someone would want to do both a fighting class and a weightlifting class. The fighting class will increase flexibility, reaction time, and hand eye coordination which are all traits an athlete wants to improve. The powerlifting class will then give you the strength to enhance your speed, power, and overall strength in sports. By doing both at the same time could give an athlete an edge over the competition who doesn’t train as vigorously. 
        Can I just use the gym to workout normally? 
        Yes you can. What we hope to have happen by joining our powerlifting program is that you consider our trainers advice but you don’t have to. Instead you can just use the equipment as you like while still having good gym etiquette to our other members.
