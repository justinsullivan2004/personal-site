                <p>What we Offer! At this gym we will offer two types of training for three kinds of memberships, MMA, PowerLifting, and then a membership for both. With this, customers can choose if they want to learn how to fight, train with professionals, or do both to reach a new level of athleticism. There will also be competitions that customers can enter so they can apply their fighting training and compare their strength with others among their weight class. By doing competitions we hope to give our customers more motivation to work and push themselves by being competitive with others.</p>
